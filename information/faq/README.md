mCODE is short for Minimal Common Oncology Data Elements. It is a core set of minimum common clinical data standards developed and maintained by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) mCODE Executive Committee.

### Who is the intended user?

Clinical Research Coordinators are the intended mCODER users.

### What languages does mCODER support?

mCODER is only available in English.

### How is mCODER safe from the public and who gets access to the data?

mCODER uses a secure login system, managed by Keycloak. Keycloak is an identity and access management software. Only Nadia Znassi and Leslie Oldfield from the PughLab have the authority to approve users with access to the mCODER application. mCODER also uses a two-factor mobile authentication app for each time a user login.

### Can anybody register for an mCODER account?

No, only users with an email from UHN (uhn.ca, uhnresearch.ca) and UofT (utoronto.ca) are currently allowed.&#x20;

### Do I need to be on a UHN network VPN to access?

No, you do not need VPN to access the mCODER website.

### Is the mCODER website accessible on any browser?

The website is best accessed through a Chrome browser.

### Where is the mCODER application hosted?

Azure is hosting mCODER.

### Do the colours for each tab mean anything?

Yes, the colours are based on the mCODE standard schema developed by the ASCO mCODE Executive Committee.

### Is mCODER clinically compliant?

To support use in clinical studies, mCODER is FDA 21 CFR Part 11 compliant with user transaction audit trails, digital signatures, front- and backend-firewalls, automated daily backups.

### What if my study is already in a REDCap database, can I download the data and upload into mCODER?

No, at this point in time the user cannot import clinical data.

### Can I upload my clinical data into mCODER?

No, at this point in time the user cannot import clinical data.

### Are all the tabs mandatory to fill out?

The mandatory tabs to fill out for all studies are the first seven tabs: _Patient_, _Disease_, _Genomic_, _Treatment_, _Lab/Vital_, _Biospecimens_, and _Outcome_. The _Family Pedigree_ tab is most relevant for hereditary cancer studies. The _NF1 Clinical Features_ tab is specific to the NF1 study.

### Do I have to do the abstraction in a certain order?

It is highly recommended to abstract clinical data starting from the _Patient_ tab to the subsequent tabs. It is also highly suggested to start from the _Patient_ tab to state the patient identifier as a starting point.

### What if the options in the dropdown list and/or the choices provided does not fit the patient I am abstracting for?

If the options or choices provided does not apply, please enter the data in the comments sections provided.

### Where do I find help if I don’t understand the meaning of a field?

Please refer to the Data Dictionary on the left panel. For each field there is a definition provided.&#x20;

### Do I have to re-enter the patient identifier in each tab?

Yes, the user will need to re-enter the patient ID in each tab as there is a feature to view the previous patient data in a table format per tab.

### I don’t see a save button anywhere on the application, does the data entered automatically save?

Yes, the data automatically saves.

### What if I don’t finish an abstraction for a patient, can I come back later and continue where I left off?

Yes, fields are auto-saved, just enter the patient ID and you can continue where you left off.

### There are only three study options to choose from in the _Patient_ tab, will there be more studies available in the future?

Yes, we are hopeful that more studies will apply the mCODE standard to their clinical abstraction and use the mCODER application to do so!
