### The patient has more than one comorbid condition, is there an option to add another condition for the same patient?

Yes, scroll further down on the ‚ÄòComorbid Condition‚Äô section; at the end of this section, there is a ‚ÄòAdd a comorbid condition‚Äô button.

### What is an OncoTree Code?

An Oncotree code is a unique cancer type diagnosis code. Each cancer type diagnosis name has its own OncoTree code, an abbreviation of the full cancer type name. The OncoTree code is used to standardize cancer type diagnosis; it is developed by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK). For example, the OncoTree code for the cancer ‚ÄúStomach Adenocarcinoma‚Äù is ‚ÄúSTAD‚Äù.

### How do I figure out the OncoTree Code for a patient?

Type in the main tissue that has the disease in the text field and hit enter on your keyboard; a new popup window will display the OncoTree. The popup window will also display if you click on the ‚ÄúOpen the OncoTree‚Äù button.

#### Within the OncoTree popup, there are two routes to explore:

1. Click on the tissue with the cancer. A branch out of cancer names will display
   * The filled circles indicates that there are more cancer types that will continue to branch out once you click on it
   * The empty circles are the end of the cancer type lineage \*
     * Once you have found your cancer type name, click on the name and click the close button
       * The cancer type along with its OncoTree code in brackets is now present in the text field
2. On the top left corner, there is a text field: you can enter a cancer type here, and there will be a drop-down list of suggestions that will appear
   * Once selected, there will be a red line drawn from _Tissue_ to your specified cancer type on the OncoTree \*
     * The end point of the red line will be the specified cancer type along with the name in red font. This is the same detailed cancer type name selected on the top left corner text field.
     * _**NOTE**_: When hovering over a cancer type name, a grey box will appear with more detailed information. The abbreviation in brackets next to the detailed cancer type name is the code
       * Once you have found your cancer type name, click on the name and click the close button

The cancer type along with its OncoTree code in brackets is now present in the text field

### What if I have more than one cancer to enter for a patient?

At the bottom of the ‚ÄòTumor Data‚Äô section, there is a ‚ÄúAdd Cancer‚Äù button, this will provide you with a new ‚ÄòTumor Data‚Äô section to fill out for the patient.

### How do I enter the time period of the medication?

Start by clicking on the Period text field, a popup calendar will be displayed with two calendars. The calendar on the left is for the start date and the calendar on the right is for the end date. The double arrows (<<, >>) are to go backwards and forwards in years. The single arrows (<, >) are to go backwards and forwards in months. The selected year and month are displayed at the top of each calendar. Once you have arrived at the year and month you desire, click on the calendar for the day. \*If you have to start all over in the time period selection, simply click the clear button at the bottom right corner. Once the start and end dates have been selected, click on the confirm button.

### Why is there a family pedigree to be filled out?

The family pedigree section is not part of the mCODE standard. However, it is essential for clinical correlative studies. It provides cancer-specific information and background for each family member with relevance for hereditary cancer syndromes.

### How do I use the Family Pedigree tab?

Start by clicking on the ‚ÄúOpen the Pedigree Application‚Äù button. A popup window will be displayed. As a reminder to the user, the patient identifier is again displayed at the top of the popup window. The family pedigree itself is in the grey section of the window. A family pedigree is started for the user with a father, mother and the patient. Hovering over a family member, a grey box will appear.

#### These are the options when hovering over a family member:

![Pedigree family member](../../.gitbook/assets/pedigree\_fam\_mem)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/pedigree\_settings\_options) Add data for the selected family member

![](../../.gitbook/assets/pedigree\_older\_fam.png)Add the family member‚Äôs predecessors

![](../../.gitbook/assets/pedigree\_younger\_fam) Add the family member‚Äôs successors

![](../../.gitbook/assets/pedigree\_add\_partner) Add a partner for the family member

![](../../.gitbook/assets/pedigree\_mem\_delete) Delete the family member

#### **To enter data for a family member**:

Click on the settings icon ![](../../.gitbook/assets/pedigree\_add\_data) to enter data for the selected family member. A new popup window will appear

![Pedigree family member form](../../.gitbook/assets/pedigree\_form)

Fill out the form. Under the ‚ÄúAge of Diagnosis‚Äù disease fields, there are different colours indicated next to each field. Depending on if any of the fields for the listed diseases are filled out, upon closing the window, the pedigree box will become the same colour as the disease. If more than one of the Age of Diagnosis disease fields are filled out, the pedigree box will be coloured with all the colours of these completed fields. If none of the fields for the diseases are filled out, the pedigree box will not change colour and will remain white.

* When these disease fields are filled out, the disease name and age will be displayed underneath the pedigree box. Refer to the image below for an example
